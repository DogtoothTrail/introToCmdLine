This tutorial covers basic commands necessary for using the command line shell in UNIX-like operating systems, including MacOSX and Linux. It is aimed at biologists beginning the journey through bioinformatics, and introduces the user to moving around the directory file system, creating, moving, and renaming text files. It ends with a discussion of file permissions and introduces shell scripting for the first time. 

I first generated this tutorial for the Pleurocarp Moss Tree of Life workshop and software school in October 2013.
